    % ABSTRACT 
    \begin{abstract}        
    This paper shows an operational deployment of the \texttt{SSH} honeypot using \texttt{cowrie} on an \textit{Ubuntu} \texttt{EC2} instance to capture attacker activity in real-world circumstances. By exposing a knowingly open SSH port on the Internet and securing legitimate access with a cryptographic key on a different port, the study observes and inspects adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (\textit{TTPs}). Key steps include isolating the honeypot space from production access using \texttt{fail2ban}, redirecting malicious traffic to \texttt{cowrie} via \texttt{iptables}, and forging artifacts to track attacker activity. A walkthrough of the settings is covered to demonstrate a complete implementation in \texttt{cowrie}, as this paper remains focused on the hands-on aspect of honeypot-based deception. Additionally, cloud provider configurations (e.g., IAM, networking) are not included as implementation-specific and beyond the scope of this paper. This project's public \texttt{git} repository is available at \href{https://github.com/nottoBD/netsec-cowrie-honey}{that location}.

    % section INTRODUCTION
    \section{Introduction}

    Lance Spitzner, a seminal researcher and Senior Instructor for SANS Cybersecurity Leadership, established foundational principles in his 2002 book \textit{Honeypots: Tracking Hackers}. 
    Despite its age, Spitzner's core thesis retains striking relevance in modern threat intelligence; Honeypots derive value from \enquote{being probed, attacked, or compromised} (p. 23). Our Cowrie implementation on AWS positions itself onto that continuity, demonstrating that Spitzner's \enquote{gaining value from data} challenge (Ch.4) persists against contemporary attacks. In addition, the attacker behaviors documented in 2002 remain prevalent even today. Furthermore, Spitzner's risk mitigation framework (Ch.12) comprises a wide set of obstacles one encounters when building such deceptive system, mainly signature-based detection tools that inform attackers about the underlying nature of our operation; \enquote{a system designed to be attacked} (p. 298). 
    
    
    With more advanced automated \texttt{SSH}-based attacks, empirical analysis of attacker processes has been crucial in strengthening defenses. By mimicking realistic infrastructure while isolating malicious activity from legitimate administrative access, this proof of concept applies Spitzner's principles of honeypot deployment, specifically leveraging \texttt{medium-interaction design} (Ch.5) to find the correct trade-off between risk containment and attacker engagement. Through silent redirection of open-to-the-public SSH traffic to the honeypot and restriction of legitimate access with key-based authentication, the study allows the monitoring of attacker activities in fine granularity without compromising the security of systems, proving Spitzner's assertion that honeypots provide \textit{«small amounts of high-value data»} without production noise.

        % subsection PROBLEM STATEMENT
        \subsection{Problem Statement} 
        Public \texttt{SSH} services are some of the most frequent targets of credential stuffing and post-compromise persistence attacks (e.g.,\texttt{SSH} key injection, cronjob exploitation). Conventional defenses measures lack visibility of attacker's \texttt{TTPs} (Techniques, Tactics \& Procedures). A gap Spitzner attributes their inability to naturally distinguish between legitimate and hostile activity (Ch. 4). This research addresses three significant challenges: 
            
            - \texttt{Safe isolation of production access}: Mitigating Spitzner’s identified risk of collateral system compromise through architectural \enquote{separation of honeypot lures from administrative channels} (Ch. 3, 12).

            - \texttt{Deception efficacy for engagement}: Designing credible system emulations (e.g., service banners, file structures, false credentials) to prolong attacker interaction and avoid detection as a honeypot.

            
            - \texttt{High-fidelity TTP capture}: Engineering logging mechanisms that overcome environmental distortion in production systems. Able to capture attackers' behavior without affecting environmental integrity.

        % subsection RESEARCH QUESTIONS
        \subsection{Research Questions}
        In order to learn about attacker motives and organization through research honeypots, this study investigates:

            - \texttt{Credential exploitation patterns}: Which username/password pairs dominate automated brute-force campaigns against internet-exposed SSH? (Extending Spitzner’s analysis of \enquote{targets of opportunity} and scripted tools in Ch. 4.) 

            - \texttt{Persistence mechanism prioritization}: How do attackers strategically deploy backdoors (e.g., key injections, cronjobs) post-compromise? \enquote{Persistence, not advanced technical skills, is how these attackers successfully break into a system.} (Ch. 2, p. 35)

            - \texttt{Decoy efficacy for intelligence gathering}: To what extent do fabricated system artifacts (e.g., \textit{/etc/shadow} entries) prolong attacker engagement to enhance TTP profiling? (Testing Spitzner’s concept of deception as \enquote{psychological weapons used to mess with and confuse a human attacker} in Ch. 4, p. 74).

    % section SSH ISOLATION &  HARDENING
    \section{SSH Isolation \& System Hardening}
    Clear goal-setting, suitable interaction levels, reliable data collection, and risk mitigation are all highlighted in Spitzner's honeypot deployment framework (Ch. 12). In order to study automated SSH-based attacks, in this section we concentrate on segregating legitimate SSH access with cryptographic controls and configuring a simple intrusion prevention system called \textit{fail2ban}. Making sure that these techniques are in line with Spitzner's recommendations for safe and efficient honeypot operation.
        
        \subsection{Administrative Controlled Access}
    Administrative SSH access is limited to key-based authentication on a non-standard port (e.g.: 2223) in accordance with Spitzner's advice to reduce risk through secure configurations (Ch. 12). By removing password-based vulnerabilities, this reduces the attack surface and is consistent with the idea of protecting the underlying platform. The setup ensures strong isolation of authorized access by enforcing contemporary cryptographic standards to stop downgrade attacks.

        \end{lstlisting}
        
        
        \subsection{Fail2ban Configuration} To improve detection of unauthorized access attempts, Fail2Ban is set up to monitor key-based authentication failures on port 2223 and following Spitzner's assertion that detection is a central function of a honeypot (Ch. 12), this configuration targets repeat public key failures, which can be facilitated through credential-stuffing attacks. Potentially malicious SSH connections will have fair, high-fidelity logging of attempts to authenticate via public keys. Given that the honeypot contains a deliberately misleading environment, the configuration will not interfere with coded logging and will be able to detect ongoing attacks. This configuration does not monitor any password attempts, as password-based administrative access has been disabled, to avoid receiving false positive logging data.
        
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={Custom Jail Rules}]
 # /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ssh-admin.conf

 findtime = 10m
 bantime  = 30m
        \end{lstlisting}
        
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={Regex Filter Against Key-Based Attacks}]
 # /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/sshd.conf
failregex = %(cmnfailre)s
            <mdre-<mode>>
            ^%(__prefix_line)s(?: Received disconnect from <HOST> port \d+: Too many authentication failures | Disconnected from <HOST> port \d+ due to: Authentication failed for .* publickey )
            %(cfooterre)s
        \end{lstlisting}
        
        
        \subsection{IPtables Redirection}
        Using Spitzner's idea of port forwarding through Network Address Translation (NAT) (Ch. 12), all traffic to the standard SSH port (22) is re-routed to the Cowrie honeypot on port 2222. This helps separate the malicious activity from the legitimate usage taking place on port 2223, and helps support Spitzner's idea of compartmentalization to separate the honeypot from the production systems and avoid any conflicts (Ch. 12, p. 317). Additionally, our group collaborators' IP addresses could be whitelisted for a much tighter defense. 
        
        The \texttt{sshd} to \texttt{cowrie} ({ports \textit{22}} $\rightarrow$ \textit{2222}) redirection is a security design with multiple benefits: both processes avoid conflicting with each other as they can restart separately, binding to high ports does not require root privileges, also, \texttt{fail2ban} needs an explicit target to be effective. Compartmentalization is a key principle for any deceptive operation, we also ensure an appropriate foundation for clean and comprehensive post-attack analysis.
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={Traffic Redirection to Cowrie}]

 sudo apt install iptables-persistent netfilter persistent
 sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 22 -j REDIRECT --to-port 2222
 sudo ip6tables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 22 -j REDIRECT --to-port 2222
 sudo netfilter-persistent save

        \subsection{Validation Metrics}  
        \label{sec:validation}  
        
        To ensure rigorous validation, we verify component functionality and isolation using cybersecurity tools. The following \hyperref[annexes:network]{Annex} align with Spitzner's focus on testing processes to validate functionality. Validation for network isolation occurs with nmap and iptables to verify traffic is being redirected. Fail2Ban regex exactness is tested against simulated brute-forcing of SSH keys. SSH configuration is validated for compliance to cryptography and resist downgrade attacks.
        


    \section{Cowrie Honeypot Setup}
    Honeypots differ by level of interaction: low-interaction emulates the minimal service much of the time to detect attackers; medium-interaction such as Cowrie employ a controlled environment withstanding an attacker's impact; high-interaction (like Honeynets) provides access to fully functioning Operating Systems allowing as much dynamic information gathering as possible.
    Spitzner emphasizes the importance of tailoring honeypots to specific needs: \enquote{Developing your own honeypot is not as complicated as it might seem. Using a variety of commonly found security tools, some basic code, and a lot of creativity, you can create many different honeypots} (Ch.9). Cowrie’s configuration leverages this flexibility, allowing customization of emulated services to capture specific attacker behaviors. This section details the deployment of the medium-interaction Honeypot Cowrie on a AWS EC2 instance. 
    
\label{sec:cowrie}
    \subsection{System Requirements}
    Cowrie runs under a privileged account that's not root, with timed-out sudo privileges to ensure least privilege principle. Attack surface minimization is offered by authbind on port binding, eliminating traditional root escalation threats by privileged port allocation. Compartmentalization is used to isolate dependencies through Python virtual environments, which help hide each of the libraries and potential exploits from one another, no conflicts may arise. These measures specifically address reducing lateral movement possibilities in case of compromise. 
    
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={Cowrie User Creation}]
sudo apt-get install -y git python3-venv python3-pip libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential libpython3-dev authbind
sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" cowrie   # Prevents password-based connections 
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsection{Functional Configuration}
    The following commands compartmentalize Cowrie within a virtual environment and enforce port isolation. Find the latest Cowrie official documentation at \href{https://docs.cowrie.org/en/latest/INSTALL.html}{docs.cowrie.org}.
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={Cowrie Honeypot Setup}]
# Operate as cowrie user

cd cowrie  

# Isolate dependencies using Python venv
python3 -m venv cowrie-env

    \section{Maximizing Engagement with Deception}

As Spitzner points out with respect to the psychological effects of deception, \enquote{This can confuse an attacker and potentially waste his time and resources} (Ch. 9), but he also cautions that deception is ineffective against automated threats: \enquote{Automated tools such as worms or auto-rooters will not be deceived}. This suggests deception can be useful against human attackers, though it has limitations against automated attacks.
